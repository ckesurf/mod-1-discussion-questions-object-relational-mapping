# ORM Discussion Questions

Consider the following questions with the people at your table. Write down your
answers in a notebook or on a whiteboard.

1. First, discuss with your table - what is an ORM? Why is an ORM useful?

Answer:

```
ORM - Object Relational Mapper
Helps ruby interact with SQL
Tables are classes
Rows are instances
Columns are attributes
```

2. Pretend that you're building Twitter. Let's say that a tweet has a message
   and belongs to a User. A User has a username and has_many tweets. What
   columns would be on those two tables?

Answer:

```
User
- id
- name

Tweet
- id
- message
- user_id
```

3. Now that we have our tables, pretend that we are defining a method on our
   User class that returns all the tweets. What SQL fires when this method is
   called?

Answer:

```sql
SELECT * FROM tweets;
```

4. Writing out all of these database interactions by hand can be messy. How
   would you create a method on the superclass to make sure the correct SQL
   fires for each class?

```rb
class LiveRecord

  def self.all
    # Add code here!
  end
end

class Dog < LiveRecord
end

class Cat < LiveRecord

end

Dog.all #=> 'SELECT * FROM dogs'
Cat.all #=> 'SELECT * FROM cats'
```
